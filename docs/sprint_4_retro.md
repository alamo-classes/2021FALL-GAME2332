# Sprint 4 Retro

## Mad
* School computers not having the right unity
* Planet mesh colliders
* all the issues with the planet
* camera rework
* lack of unity knowledge (assets)

## Sad
* planet biomes
* sprint not complete but close
* speed of imports and pushes
* time taken on certain tasks
* lonely struggle

## Glad
* forest assets
* the game is still having features added
* progress of game (overall)
* that you can see progression (3 week ago vs now)
* group collab

### Take-Away
* Focus on putting the polish on the features you do finish this sprint
* Overall good progress, just need to focus on the last of the tasks to finish the game
